Pre-read
Before I begin the notes, the main things I have questions on are:
Do batteries have resistance; why can my microcontroller supply a 5/3v voltage, but not very high amps?
How do resistors stop current flow; do they also reduce voltage?
How do I understand intutively and deeply how electricity flows?
How do I understand the current and voltage at every part of a circuit?
Intuitively, what does current vs. voltage do?">

<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/currentflow.jpg">
<p>Current is the amount of charge flowing past a point per unit time. If we have a point &lsquo;A&rsquo; in space, the current is how much charge passes through, in how much time:</p>
<p>$$
I_{avg}=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}
$$</p>
<p>Furthermore, we take the limit: $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ in order to get the approximate current at exactly a specific time (we would measure a small amount of current over a very small time period).</p>
<p>The unit we use is <em>columbs per second</em> which is also an ampere. A coloumb is a unit of charge (electrons).</p>
<p>The &lsquo;current&rsquo; we are talking about are free electrons from conductors such as copper moving through the wire, which can move because metals have free electrons in their outer-shells. The charge on one electron/proton is:</p>
<p>$$

<h2 id="batteries">Batteries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#batteries">#</a></h2>
<p>Before we go into any more detail, let&rsquo;s try to understand this fundamental source of energy, that harnesses chemical energy, and turns it into electrical energy.</p>
<p>We have two sides of the battery: the anode, and the cathode. The cathode is the positive side, which would be a metal that is more likely to &lsquo;want&rsquo; an electron to be in a stable state, while the anode is the negative part that &lsquo;wants to give electrons&rsquo; to be more stable.</p>
<p>However, the atoms are stable as they are, and need some &rsquo;liberating&rsquo; force before they are able to move from the cathode to the anode; this is why we have some acidic solution/electrolyte that &lsquo;removes&rsquo; electrons from the solution.</p>
<p>Then once we start taking electrons from the metals, we are able to add more through the wire, and therefore have some current-flow!</p>
<p>This is very oversimplified, and ignores a lot of chemistry, but hopefuly it provides a basic idea for what a battery is doing, and how it could provide an electromotive force.</p>
<p>Modern batteries like lithium batteries also use ingenius design to be rechargable!</p>

<h2 id="voltage">Voltage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#voltage">#</a></h2>
<p>Now, if we apply a battery across a wire, we will generate a force that &lsquo;pushes&rsquo; the electrons to be in the more positive side of the wire, due to chemical force we described above.</p>
<p>This is called an electromagnetic force, and is voltage. Think of voltage as the magnitude of the force, but not the overall potential energy (it could be only a short, high-voltage).</p>
<p>One can imagine voltage, as being determined by the strength of the battery.</p>
<p>While a larger surface area would just cause more potential electrons to be swapped (longer battery life), a higher voltage would be acheived only by choosing more negative/positive/reactive metals. Each electron would experience a stronger &lsquo;driving force&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Another way to view the force, is that electric charges get built up at the negative terminal of the battery. These charges then &lsquo;push&rsquo; eachother to the positive side, and cause a chain reaction throughout the wire &lsquo;pushing&rsquo; each other electron to the positive terminal, where they are attracted. Furthermore, it could be imagined that deeper in the circuit, the electrons feel less of a &lsquo;push&rsquo;, as there are objects in the way that may repel (somehpow) the original force. A deeper understanding of circuitry, and electromagnetic theory is requiered to understand this.</p>
<p>It is just important to know that voltage is associated with the amount of &lsquo;push&rsquo; the electrons experience, or how &rsquo;eager&rsquo; they are to get to the positive region/away from the negative region.</p>
<p>Voltage can be defined as:</p>
<p>$$
V_{AB} = \frac{U_{AB}}{q}
$$</p>
<p>where AB is the difference between points A and B, u is the potential energy, and b is the charge.</p>
<p>Intuitvely, if we have a very high potential for energy, and a very small amount of charge, the voltage is very large; a few electrons (charges) are making a lot of energy!</p>
<p>Note that usually just &lsquo;V&rsquo; is used; the fact that it is a difference between two points is always implied.</p>
<p>We can also note that this voltage formula implies that the energy generated is equal to the voltage times the charge; where if we have 1 amp and 2 volts, we generate 2 j/s.</p>
<p>We can define a volt as providing enough potential difference to give 1 coloumb of charge one joule of energy.</p>
<h3 id="voltage-drop">voltage drop<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#voltage-drop">#</a></h3>
<p>When energy is used in the circuit (IE 3v for an LED), voltage is used up, and there is less potential energy than before. Furthermore in different parts of the LED, the voltage will be different, and larger depending on how different their potential energies are.</p>
<p>The intuition behind this, is that we are using some of the electrons energy up by doing some work, or producing something. Therefore, although our battery terminals will have the same voltage, voltage across the circuit will vary, depending on &lsquo;how much&rsquo; the electron has done.</p>
<p>We refer to this as a voltage drop: for example, our conductors have very low voltage-drop since the electrons are not doing any work (ideally), but an LED that takes up a lot of energy, will have a high voltage drop (electrons before the LED have much more energy than the electrons that have &lsquo;used it up&rsquo; going through the LED).</p>
<p>I like to think of the whole thing as having some magnetic/eletric &lsquo;driving force&rsquo; which continually pushes a current, but the amount of voltage, or energy in the electrons is finite, and can be used up while they are being pushed. While in reality it is more complex, this continous flow, and stored energy is a good practical analogy.</p>
<h2 id="combining-batteriespower-sources">Combining Batteries/Power Sources<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#combining-batteriespower-sources">#</a></h2>
<p>If we wanted a larger voltage than one battery alone would give, and we had two batteries, we can connect them in series, and their voltage adds. The intuition behind this, is that now getting electrons from each battery want to flow. Note that sometimes we use a refrence &lsquo;ground&rsquo; point as zero volts, this makes reading circuits easier at times, but just remember that always voltages are relative, and current is flowing from one end of a battery to its own other.</p>
<h2 id="water-analogy-to-voltage">Water Analogy to Voltage<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#water-analogy-to-voltage">#</a></h2>
<p>For practical purposes, water can be a great analogy for voltage.</p>
<p>We could look at the voltage source (IE battery) as a water pump, and then wires as tubes through which the water flowed. The voltage could be seen as &lsquo;water pressure&rsquo;; the water pressure before it preforms work on a load would be high, and then afterwords, it would have lower pressure (imagine some being dissapated into the environemnt).</p>

<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/wateranalvolt.png">
<p>furthermore, we can extend this analogy to how more water &lsquo;pressure&rsquo; induces more current to flow for a point, and the overall flow reamins constant, and proportional to the resistance.</p>
<p>We can imagine this is on a chemical level, because more electrons are propelling eachother, and each electron therefore has a greater potential energy.</p>
<h2 id="conduction">Conduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Conductors such as copper, and other metals form structures that allow for free-flowing electrons from the valence shells of the different atoms, due to the atomic properties of these metals.</p>
<p>Although the electrons are &lsquo;free&rsquo; inside the metal, they do not escape due to the attractice forces of the positive metal ions in the structure of the metal atom.</p>
<p>When a voltage is applied across a conductor, an electric field travels at about the speed of light across the wire, pushing all electrons at the same time, and applying a force to them.</p>
<h2 id="resistanceconductivity">Resistance/Conductivity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistanceconductivity">#</a></h2>
<p>Georg Simon Ohm found that, expirimentally, resistance is inversley proportional to how much current flows through a wire, given a constant voltage.</p>
<p>This is known as ohms law: $1\Omega = 1V/1A$.</p>
<p>However, this is not necessarily a &rsquo;law&rsquo;, but rather a macroscopic property that arises in materials. Some materials don&rsquo;t even obey this law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in wires resistance is proportional to the length (inversly) and the cross-sectional area (more space for electrons to flow). This can partially be explained, because there are less electrons flowing in a thicker wire per unit area, meaning less on-average collisions.</p>
<h3 id="conductivityresistivity">Conductivity/Resistivity<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conductivityresistivity">#</a></h3>
<p>Reisitivity is defined as $\rho=R\frac{A}{L}$ which is the inherent &lsquo;resistivness&rsquo; of a material. Conductivity is simply the inverse.</p>
<p>Furthermore, metals can follow this law:</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\rho_{0}\left[ 1+\alpha(T-T_{0}) \right]
$$</p>
<p>which just means temperature linearly scales resistance by some constant.</p>
<h3 id="what-explains-different-resistances">What Explains different resistances?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-explains-different-resistances">#</a></h3>
<p>Different atoms have a different number of valence shells that electrons can lie within. If a given material has a partially empty band, it will much more easily give/take electrons, because it doesn&rsquo;t have to jump a &lsquo;gap&rsquo; to the next levels.</p>
<h2 id="heat-and-power">Heat and Power<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#heat-and-power">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that we understand the macro-level workings of circuits, we can calculate the amount of energy used to be converted to heat in a circuit. If we have a circuit with 0.1 Amps, and 10 volts, and one &lsquo;black box&rsquo;, assuming the black box is a resistor, we can calculate that it takes up 1j/s of power (1 watt).</p>
<p>Often, a useful trick is done, which is to treat any load as a resistor, and preform circuit anaylsis this way.</p>
<h2 id="basic-electric-circuits">Basic Electric Circuits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#basic-electric-circuits">#</a></h2>
<p>If we connect elements in series, the same current is doing work over all of those elements, and each of their voltages must add up to the overall voltage.</p>
<p>However, if in parallel, the current splits up, with the same-voltage.</p>
<h3 id="other-components">Other components<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#other-components">#</a></h3>
<p>Some elements in circuits do not obey ohms law (LED&rsquo;s for example, use almost the same amount of voltage no matter what), and therefore we must account for this in our calculations, treating components as kind of resistors, when caluclating there power requirements/doing circuit analysis.</p>
<p>Resistors are a special case where current varies linearly with voltage, however with some components, increasing the does not mean a decrease in &lsquo;work done&rsquo; (a lot of volt drop, not a lot of resistivity). In this sense, resistors are just components that happen to work nicely, because V=IR. Therefore we can use them to help us regulate voltage/current flow in circuits.</p>
<h2 id="ground">Ground<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ground">#</a></h2>

<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/ground.png">
<p>When talking about ground, and using the above symbol, one can mean either the negative battery-terminal, a refrence 9-voltage point, or the actual <em>earth&rsquo;s</em> ground.</p>
<p>The most simple example is when ground is just the negative terminal of the battery, and we define every other voltage relative to this.</p>
<p>Another example is when we choose a point to be 0v that has &rsquo;negative&rsquo; voltage relative to it; that would push electrons in the opposite direction. This could be handy if we were monitoring a sinusodial current that when positive and negative.</p>
<h3 id="earth-ground">Earth-ground<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#earth-ground">#</a></h3>
<p>However, a true ground would be considered earth, where charges cancel out to be exactly zero. Someone would literally stick a metal rod in earth in order to take high-voltage and drive it into the earth.</p>
<p>The reason this is important, is because multiple devices can share a <em><strong>common refrence point</strong></em>, even if they are connected to multiple different power-sources, they can always measure against 0V.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to measure the difference between one device and another, or even if we want to power two devices that are close (and don&rsquo;t want a potential difference, so some charge transfer may accidentally happen), we would benefit from a common ground.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Well, for the example when we&rsquo;re measuring something with a different powersupply, sharing a &lsquo;common ground&rsquo; is intuitive. If we are just measuring the raw voltage with no ground, we will get very unstable measurements, because even though both terminals of the other supply may be changing, we don&rsquo;t have acess to this (relative) information, we only have our ground to compare with, and <em>by definition, voltage is a relative comparison</em>. Therefore, if we simply plug in the other ground, we get stable voltage.</p>
<p>Here are two measurementsfrom my ESP32, the first with a common ground, the second without:</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/gdmg.png">

<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/gdmng.png"></p>
<p>Then, why does having common ground help in other cases, when we&rsquo;re not just measuring? Well, the idea is that if an electrical component fails, having all components connected to a common ground, means that the current will immediately flow to the ground of the earth, with near zero resistance, and it won&rsquo;t have any reason to go through a humans body!</p>
<p>To summarize, the ground can either be refrence points between measuring equipments, in order to measure relative amounts, and allow current to flow, and we also have a ground wire that connects into the earth (and back to the electrical component), in order to prevent shock in the case of failure. (it prevents shock, because it acts as very low resistance, and therefore, there will be very low voltage across it, and verys small power, the batteries internal resistance takes it all).</p>
<p>The correct wiring, is to connect ground to the negative terminal (electrons flow to earth from here).</p>
<p>There are different signals for chasis (negative metal frame everything is connected to), and earth ground symbols, however they are often confused.</p>
<h3 id="noise-in-grounding">Noise in grounding:<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#noise-in-grounding">#</a></h3>
<p>Ideally, we would have all parts of a circuit flow back through a common ground. This is usually acheived through having one long thick peice of wire that can carry the sum of all the currents.</p>
<p>We want to do this, because having multiple grounds can cause errors in voltage-readings at different points, and if we use one ground, we can have one refrence for everything.</p>
<h3 id="analog-vs-digital-grounds">Analog vs. digital grounds<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analog-vs-digital-grounds">#</a></h3>
<p>Digital voltages may spike at times, when, for example, the resistance of one component changes (therefore, the resistance across other components will change), while analog circuits can also experience this change in voltage.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is common practice to keep the AC/DC grounds &rsquo;locally&rsquo; seperated, and only connect them at one point in the circuit.</p>
<p><em><strong>As we expiriment with circuits in the future, we will see the practical use and understand these concepts deeper!</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="series-and-parallel">Series and Parallel<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#series-and-parallel">#</a></h2>
<p>When thinking about elements in series, we are simply adding the resistance, and adding the voltage across the elements; the &lsquo;same electrons&rsquo; are being used to drive a force.</p>
<p>However, in parallel electrons go down one of multiple paths, and do so relative to the resistivity of those paths. However, in choosing a path, voltage does not change; therefore the voltage across the two paths will be the same (but current split).</p>
<p>This applies for any number of paths, and voltages.</p>
<h3 id="resistance-in-parallel">Resistance in parallel<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistance-in-parallel">#</a></h3>
<p>If we want to find the total resistance in parallel, we can take two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find relative amount of charge that flows to each pathway</li>
<li>Find average resistance based on proportion of charges that flowed through this resistance</li>
</ol>
<p>which comes out to be:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{x}^{n}\frac{1}{\frac{\cancel{R_{x}}}{\sum_{x}^{n}R_{x}}\cdot \cancel{R_{x}}}
$$</p>
<p>which is usually expressed as:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}&hellip;}
$$</p>
<p>Which may seem like a lot, but is really just calculating the proportion of electrons going in each direction, and then getting the resistance based on this, which lends itself to this nice equation.</p>
<p>Which intuitively shows how if we have some low-resistance paths that most electrons go to, there will be low overall resistance, however for high-resistance paths <em>only</em> electrons will experience high resistance on average.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the more paths we have, no matter what the less resistance.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to note that this isn&rsquo;t exactly an average. The more paths, the smaller the resistance, even if the resistance is the same across each path. This can also be formulated as</p>
<p>$$
I_{total}=I_{1}+I_{2}+&hellip;+I_{n}
$$</p>
<p>which is the sum of currents,</p>
<p>$$
=V_{1}/R_{1}+V_{2}/R_{2}+&hellip;+V_{n}/R_{n}
$$</p>
<p>and because they&rsquo;re in parallel</p>
<p>$$
=V_{total}/R_{1}+V_{total}/R_{2}+&hellip;+V_{total}/R_{n}
$$</p>
<p>which can be factored out as</p>
<p>$$
R_{total} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_{1}}+&hellip;+\frac{1}{R_{n}}}
$$</p>
<p>the idea behind this is that we are solving for the resistance at each step given we know the currents proportionality and the constant-voltage.</p>
<p>More inuitively, it gives us a concrete way to express how, for splitting up the voltage into multiple parts, we can drive n times the power, if we just add more resistors in parallel of the same-rating (because the current in has to equal the current out, the overall resistance lowers to account for the individual V=IRs).</p>
<p>To summarize, the resistance in parallel formula is just making sure V=IR is obeyed for each parallel part of the circuit.</p>
<h3 id="resistors-in-series">Resistors in Series<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#resistors-in-series">#</a></h3>
<p>Resistors in series, intuitively add their resistance, and each take up a voltage proportional to their resistance relative to the whole!</p>
<h3 id="voltage-dividers">Voltage Dividers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#voltage-dividers">#</a></h3>
<p>An important thing we can do with resistors in series, is divide the voltage. We could, for example take a 10 volt battery, and split it into 5 volts, and connect an LED to ground and across a resistor in the middle, to get this desired 5 volt affect.</p>
<p>The intuition behind this, is that we are using electrons while they have around halve of their total potential energy (or any other amount that we can easily vary with resistance).</p>

<h3 id="kirkhoffs-law">Kirkhoffs law<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#kirkhoffs-law">#</a></h3>
<p>Although this is intutivive, it is an important rule of thumb:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sum of voltages in series of components is equal to overall voltage</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Sum of current entering a junction must equal sum of individual currents flowing through each part (flowing out)</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-10-rule">The 10% rule<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-10-rule">#</a></h3>
<p>When we pick something like an LED to be across the V-OUT, that has practically zero resistance, we&rsquo;ll need to divide the current between the resistor and the element we choose.</p>
<p>Therefore, a handy trick when calculating the desired resistance to divide a circuit is the 10% rule.</p>
<p>Here is how I understand it:</p>
<ol>
<li>know the desired voltage and current of a component</li>
<li>For a voltage divider, calculate the resistance at a given point, such that with the desired voltage, the resistor draws 10% of the amps necessary for the component</li>
<li>Calculate the other resistance for the other part of the voltage division: component + 10% of component amps, at the desired voltage</li>
</ol>
<p>While this at first may seem arbitrary, it is actually designing a series resistor such that one of the resistors, which is a parallel resistor, draws the right amount of current where the component is, with the correct amount of voltage; and the resistor component only takes up ~10% of power (in series). This is a good quick rule to calculate values for resistors in a voltage divider circuit.</p>
<p>Since V=IR always holds, if we know the current that we want to draw from each resistor in series, and know the voltage that will be across them, we can simply use V=IR for each resistor individually, and things will work out, as the overall-resistance is just derived from this.</p>
<p>Then for the LED component, we could add a 1/10th of the resistance at the junction, so everything would work out (since LED&rsquo;s need current to be limited).</p>
<h2 id="multiple-voltage-dividers">Multiple voltage Dividers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#multiple-voltage-dividers">#</a></h2>
<p>In this problem, when we calculate our resistances, we need to look at the problem a little more generally. We may have multiple resistors, which have components connected across 1 or multiple.</p>
<p>Our bleeder current will be the <em>total</em> current that we need to supply across all voltages, we want 1/10th of this remaining in the final resistor. Intiuitively, this can be seen as each step giving some of its &lsquo;bleedage&rsquo; to compound out until the final.</p>
<p>Then, we just calculate the current across individual components (using kirkhoffs rule), given the voltages, and find the resistances.</p>
<p>Basically, we have designed a circuit that accounts for multiple componenets at different voltages, created by different resistors, and make sure they get the correct amount of current with ohms laws.</p>
<p>I like to think of it as just desinging a circuit such that everything flows down at each junction in the right amount.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind, is that we can run voltage from other components through the final components, if it can take it. This simplifies our circuit design, and the voltages are still the same.</p>
<p>Something that is also important to know, is that for multiple current sources, once we &lsquo;use&rsquo; the voltage of one current source (it must still be connected to ground), we can actually re-use this through another voltage-point, it will be just be like re-routing our current (since the electrons don&rsquo;t actually travel that fast, and we&rsquo;re just using them to do work).</p>
<h2 id="voltage-and-current-sources">Voltage and Current sources<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#voltage-and-current-sources">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="ideal-voltage-source">Ideal voltage source<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ideal-voltage-source">#</a></h3>
<p>An <em>ideal</em> voltage source would supply any voltage, regardless of the loads resistance. An ideal voltage source would have no internal resistance, and supply constant voltage to any resistance. This is infeasable, because there is some internal resistance in a battery.</p>
<p>What this means intuitively, is that we could not draw a lot of current from a battery (low $R_{Load}$), because electrical reactions happen at a certain pace, and eventually will act as a kind of resistor, resisting the amount of voltage, and therefore current, that is supplied.</p>
<p>The voltage can be seen as a series resistor in an unideal source:</p>
<p>$$
V_{Load}=V_{Total} \ \cdot \frac{R_{Load}}{R_{Load}+R_{Source}}
$$</p>
<p>$R_{Source}$ should approach zero in an ideal voltage source.</p>
<h3 id="ideal-currrent-source">Ideal Currrent source<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#ideal-currrent-source">#</a></h3>
<p>On the other hand, an ideal current source is a source that provides a steady amount of current, given different resistances. This means, the terminal voltage will scale up/down as needed, given different resistances.</p>
<p>We can think of this as a current source, with the internal, and load resistances in parallel. If the internal reistance is high, then most of the current will flow to the load, no matter what (given the load has a smaller internal resistance).</p>
<p>Here would be the formula for this model:</p>
<p>$$
I_{Load}=I_{Total} \ \cdot \frac{R_{Source}}{R_{Load}+R_{Source}}
$$</p>
<p>For any resistance in the load, the internal resistance must be high enough to force all of the charge flow through the load. Furthermore, for the source to be ideal, it must adapt to a changing $R_{Load}$ by increasing the voltage, and therefore providing the same amount of current.</p>
<p>An <em>approximation</em> of an ideal current source would be a <em>very</em> large voltage source, in series with a very large resistor. For any smaller load resistance, the current would barely change, but the voltage would scale up. This is because while ohms law &lsquo;gives&rsquo; it twice the voltage for it&rsquo;s resistance, the current barely changes, as it is mostly dictated by the larger resistor.</p>
<p>Usually, batteries are modeled as voltage sources, because more or less, batteries have a small internal resistance, and supply a relatively constant voltage, with varying current (although this breaks down at large currents).</p>
<p>Ideal current sources mostly just serve as usefull models; what if our current was constant and didn&rsquo;t change?</p>
<p>Below we can see for a real (non-ideal) voltage sources, how more current (less resistance) results in a breakdown, while for the non-ideal current source, more voltage (and therefore resistance) results in the same.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is important to note, that any battery/voltage supply can be modeled as both an ideal current and voltage source, we just change it into a parallel circuit. This works, because:</p>

<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/currentvvoltagesource.png">
<p>The common theme is that for a high voltage, and high power, real sources break down, as they have physical limitations.</p>
<p>To summarize, <em>real voltage sources</em> like batteries have some internal resistance, and therefore for a large enough current, most voltage will be used in the internal resistance (acts like a resistor in series). While <em>real current sources</em> cannot provide steady current for high resistances, as this would require more power and voltage. We can model non-ideal voltage sources with resistors in series (limiting internal resistance), and current sources with resistors in parallel (limiting max. current).\</p>
<p>We use these to try to understand the behaviour of batteries and current supplies in their <em><strong>operating</strong></em> ranges. It is important to understand however, that no source is ideal, and the conditions which make it less ideal (more current for a non-ideal voltage source).</p>
<h3 id="translating-between">Translating between<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#translating-between">#</a></h3>
<p>One last sidenote, is that any source with internal resistance can be expressed as an  current or voltage source.</p>
<p>We basically can use this same series model, and say that something with high internal resistance and a low relative $R_{Load}$ is close to an ideal current source, while an ideal voltage source is more like a battery, with low internal resistance.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be confused by the parallel current example, it is basically showing given that we have a current that we can fix by approximating an ideal current source, we can model it in parallalel, and calculate how much is &lsquo;stolen&rsquo; by the internal resistance based on how much larger the internal resistance is compared to $R_{Load}$. For example, if we had a resistor in series with 1m V and 1M $\Omega$, given a load resistance of 100k, we wouldn&rsquo;t be too much of an ideal current source (100k is a good proportion of overall reistance).</p>
<p>In fact, this can be modeled by the parallel example, we wanted 1 Amp ideally, we added a 10% resistance, so we only get one amp (in the series perspective) $R_{Total} = R_{s}+R_{Load}$ so we have 1/1.1 amps flowing. From the parallel perspective, we had one amp, but some of that is not flowing to the load:</p>
<p>$$
I_{Load}=I_{Total} \ \cdot \frac{R_{Source}}{R_{Load}+R_{Source}}
$$</p>
<p>so therefore, we have the same result, 1/1.1 amps flowing to the load! I think this is pretty cool, that with these very different interpretations, we can get the same result.</p>
<p>I like to think of this as the parallel example showing how much ideal voltage is &lsquo;stolen&rsquo; by a lack of large internal resistance (current flow inversly proportional to amount of resistance). The loads resistance in the series example contributes to the overall resistance by $\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{Total}}$, while the current in the parallel example is proportional to $\frac{R_{Total}}{R_{Load}}$.</p>
<p>The key mathematical formula linking them, is that for the series model, we have the current being influenced by the load proportional to:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{s}+R_{Load}}
$$</p>
<p>while in the series example, the amount of current flowing away is also:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{R_{Load}}{R_{s}+R_{Load}}
$$</p>
<p>this is the key intuition behind why both models can be used: the series show how much current is &lsquo;removed&rsquo; by the loads resistance, while the parallel shows the same amount; but models it as internal resistance!</p>
<p>Both examples mean the same thing for an ideal current source and voltage sources, and in practice they are used as simplifications for complex behaving, non-linear supplies of voltage, or current. Looking at a battery as an ideal voltage source is much easier than modeling the internal resistance (at least around appropriate operating ranges!).</p>

<p>An interesting example of a practical current source, is a circuit using transistors and rresistors. I don&rsquo;t understand how this works yet, but will get back to it!</p>
<h2 id="measuring-voltagecurrentresistance">Measuring Voltage/Current/Resistance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#measuring-voltagecurrentresistance">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about how we measure volts, amps, and ohms in a circuit, and the limitations we have vs. the ideal scenario in measuring them. In theory, a voltmeter should be able to measure voltage without drawing any current; it would be in parallel with $\infty$ resistance. An ammeter should have 0 resistance, and just measure the current flowing through a circuit at a point, not changing the voltage or resistance at all. An ohmeter should have zero resistance as well, just injecting voltage at a point, and seeing how fast it comes back.</p>
<h3 id="multimeters--the-galvanometer">Multimeters &amp; The Galvanometer<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#multimeters--the-galvanometer">#</a></h3>
<p>Clearly the ideal case is impossible, but how are voltmeters/ammeters/ohmeters designed to make good measurements? Well, the most common way to measure voltage/ohms/amps all in one device is the multimeter.</p>
<p>At the core of old multimeters were galvanamoters, which converted current into a reading.</p>
<h4 id="electromagnetism">Electromagnetism<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#electromagnetism">#</a></h4>
<p>The idea behind electromagnetism, is that when particles are moving, according the special relativity, as charges move, their fields are &lsquo;squished&rsquo;. We call the arising force &lsquo;magnetism&rsquo;, and it is essentially another electric force that arrises due to moving charges and their fields.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll get more into depth in this later, but just understand that moving charges creates an imbalance in the adjacent fields creating an &rsquo;electromagnet&rsquo;, or a force we call magnetism.</p>
<h4 id="galvanometers">Galvanometers<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#galvanometers">#</a></h4>
<p>Now, we can apply principle of electormagnetism, and exploit a current running through a wire, to move a needle that will indicate the extent of a reading/measurement. Understand that we can run a current through a coil and create a north/south electromagnet. We can exploit this to read different magnetic intensities (current intensities) in the following way:</p>

<img src="/images/posts/CircuitryBasicsNotes/images/galvanometer2.png">
<p>if we create a strong enough current, the magnet opposes the coil and creates enough torque to move the indicator. The galvanometer requires very little current (hence, a weaker coil).</p>
<p>If we connect a voltage source (in parallel as a voltmeter) to the galvanometer, and add a very large series resistor, we have the ability to have a large internal resistance, while measuring the relative voltage! (more current through resistor means approximately more volts $V=IR$).</p>
<p>For measuring the amps, we connect it to the galvanometer, but also has a parallel resistor with low resistance that skips it; so we only draw a small amount of current.</p>
<p>For measuring resistance, there is a small power source that is inside and wired to the galvanometer, when we connect the resistor, based on how resistive it is, current will flow through.</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ll have different &rsquo;terminals for each&rsquo;, and ideally they should be tuned to match (10 for both volts and amps), which is acheivable, because the circuits are seperate.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is error due to the galvanometers inherent resistance.</p>
<p>Look at the full wiring below:</p>

<h2 id="combining-batteries">Combining Batteries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#combining-batteries">#</a></h2>
<p>When we combine batteries in parallel, we get an increase in charge (n times more for n batteries), while in series, they add voltage. In series, we can think of the batteries&rsquo; electrochemical force simply adding; both of the batteries now want electrons, which will push each electron harder, adding the force that each of the battery would supply. Each electron would not only allow one of the battery parts to ionize, but now both, hence the additive force per electron.</p>
<p>While in parallel, each electron is only returning to one battery, and therefore the individual batteries output less current (but the same together), but the voltage stays the same. The intuition behind this, is that when the positive terminal is connected to the other positive terminal, the electrons are not actually experiencing more force, since each electron can only supply power to one battery. Furthermore, only 1/n of charges in each battery experience the force with <em>n</em> batteries in parallel, because the voltage is constant due to this.</p>

<h2 id="open-and-short-circuits">Open and Short Circuits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#open-and-short-circuits">#</a></h2>
<p>Open and short circuits are common problem in electronics, open circuits are when wires are not connected, and short circuits are inadvertened &lsquo;bypassing&rsquo; of the resistor, where there is excessive current flow.</p>
<p>While baterries have internal resistance (and so do wires), even if the resistance is relatively large, it will likely still supply enough current, and therefore power to damage the components. Fuses will blow when too much current is flowing, stopping short circuits.</p>
<h2 id="kirkhoffs-laws">Kirkhoffs Laws<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#kirkhoffs-laws">#</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, for a more complex network of devices, we cannot use current laws/reason with ohms law. For example, when LED&rsquo;s in series take up the same amount of voltage (very nonlinear resistance with voltage). In this case, we turn to kirkhoffs laws which are pretty self evident and intuitive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Voltage across circuit must be used! (IE if electrons start out with a given voltage, they will use it throughout the circuit at some point, be it a resistor or not), we can see this simply through V=IR, how when resistance changes, and there are multiple resistors, voltage is still all used. This makes sense, because energy is realased (and used) <em>no matter what</em> when batteries are able to transition to a more stable state.</li>
<li>Current entering a junction = exiting. Similarly, when current is flowing into a point, or out of a point, it must add up. This is because of the electromotive forces pushing current through are constant, and different paths do not change this force/amount. Current will never &lsquo;stop&rsquo; or disapear once it&rsquo;s driven by a force (it will only part in different direction!)</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, we can &rsquo;trace&rsquo; over different components in series to find there resistance, and just add it up. Similarly, we can do this for currents as well at a junction.</p>
<h3 id="loop-rule">Loop rule<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#loop-rule">#</a></h3>
<p>An interesting/practical property emerges with voltages, that has to do with the simple properties of voltage/circuitry, which basically means that <em><strong>voltages around a loop will equal to zero</strong></em>.</p>
<p>This is just a simple property about parallelism that was fitted to this somewhat arbitrary, but useful rule.</p>
<p>The reason this is true, is that for a closed loop we basically have electrons that can go in two directions (with same voltage). No matter how complicated the circuit, the electrons will end up using the same amount of energy before they &lsquo;meet up&rsquo; at the next point, or finish this loop.</p>
<p>Here is a funky example just to illustrate this (note current is flowing a direction in $R_{4}$, <em>which</em> doesn&rsquo;t matter):

<h3 id="matrices--complex-simulation">Matrices &amp; Complex simulation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#matrices--complex-simulation">#</a></h3>
<p>To solve complex, high-dimensional systems of equations, we can employ techniques from linear algebra to compute solutions for these. Most circuit designers will use  a computer simulation/calculator for the simplicity, and fundamentally, the algorithm at the heart of these is a matrix-solving algorithm, in which we plug in a bunch of kirkhoffs equations to solve for current and resistance.</p>
<p>To breifly give an overview of it, we basically find the determinant of the high-dimensional system of equations, and divide this by the solution plugged in at the nth vector! This is interesting, and we&rsquo;ll come back to solving/understanding this. Just know that this is what is used to solve the systems of equations.</p>
<h2 id="superposition-theorem">Superposition Theorem<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#superposition-theorem">#</a></h2>
<p>This theorem is simply describing a property of circuits that is resistricted to linear systems.</p>
<p>It says that the <em><strong>current in a &lsquo;branch&rsquo;  of a circuit is equal to the current of all the sources (times a coefficient each), with other ones set to zero</strong></em>. This simply means that the amount of current supplied throughout the circuit is linear: if we add another battery with the same voltage, due to V=IR, the current will double. The other sources do not affect the resistances, they scale at the same rate (linear) no matter what.</p>
<p>This is useful, because given multiple voltages or current sources, we can just take them one at a time, and is good for practical circuit analysis.
