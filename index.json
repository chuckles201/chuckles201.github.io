[{"content":"\nContent below was automatically extracted from the readme.md of my autosocial LLM integration project:\nautosocial Automatically posts to all desired socials, finetuned LLM writes appealing/good titles and descriptions for each platform.\nGUI: Watch video:\nPart 1: Posting First, let\u0026rsquo;s understand each social-media that we\u0026rsquo;ll want to post to:\nHow we make the post (API/other workaround for automatic post) What format it expects (title, description, subtitle, etc.) The platforms I want to use:\nHackernews Reddit X Medium Discord \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; For future\nYoutube (shorts,post) Instagram (shorts,post) Part 2: LLM \u0026amp; Instructions, GUI Next, I\u0026rsquo;d like to create an instruction-set/prompt for the LLM we choose to use, that makes it write an appealing summary/description of our post. The pipeline will be:\nGive LLM post and instructions (with gui?) Take LLM\u0026rsquo;s post, and post it with the format we find in the previous step Part 3: Track metrics Automatically track the metrics for our post (as provided by the platform), and have a dashboard to see the metrics for each post.\nAlso, maybe have a system for integrating the comments across all socials, or at least displaying some of the metrics shared across all platforms on each platform, and also provide links to each other platform that it was posted on!\nConclusion: Working with AI like future Write the conclusion about how you think AI will revoultionize communication, from governments/poltics, to reaching out to people. Will social and speaking abilities be rendered irrelevant?

Sharing Knowledge With this blog I aim to share my projects, which are manifestations of my learning through my own thinking, and learning from the knowledge created by others.\nI will attempt to make this blog high-quality, educational, and dense in knowledge/learning; and importantly, everything I will share will (hopefully) be interesting/worth sharing.\n2. Community I am writing here, because I beleive that sharing with the community is a great way to motivate myself, and to truly push myself to further understand. I hope that you comment on my post, share feedback, and take-part!\nI\u0026rsquo;d imagine something like this to describe why sharing with the community can be beneficial:\nWhile this is very un-nuanced, I still think it is good, and somewhat describes why knowledge should be shared!\n3. Depth of knowledge The most important part of this blog is learning and deeply understanding. With every project/post, I will be asking the question: how can I dig deeper?
