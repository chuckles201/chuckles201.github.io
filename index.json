Sharing Knowledge With this blog I aim to share my projects, which are manifestations of my learning through my own thinking, and learning from the knowledge created by others.\nI will attempt to make this blog high-quality, educational, and dense in knowledge/learning; and importantly, everything I will share will (hopefully) be interesting/worth sharing.\n2. Community I am writing here, because I beleive that sharing with the community is a great way to motivate myself, and to truly push myself to further understand.
